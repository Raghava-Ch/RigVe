## 🖥️ Unleashing the Beauty of Code

RigVe transforms complex code into visually stunning diagrams that are not just easy to understand but also a delight to look at. Whether you’re debugging, presenting, or exploring your code, RigVe turns every line into a work of art. 🎨

In the modern era of software development, understanding the intricate flow of code is essential. RigVe bridges the gap between abstract code and intuitive design by converting your code into meaningful, colorful diagrams that speak volumes at a glance.

## 📽️ Demo
### Sequence Diagram
This diagram explains about the function and its function calls to the file definiton is available recursively

## 💡 Good to Know
This release is meant for **review** purposes. You may review it on your YouTube channel, share your opinions on social media, or any other platform you wish. Current release of the tool will work with C Language projects. You may use it in your project, as the tool is in a pre-alpha state. Take a backup of your project’s source code and use the tool to better understand your code.

### Data Security:
This tool is not designed to collect data such as diagnostics, test results, crash reports, or personal identification. In other words, it should work on a local network of the computer. Connecting to the internet is considered tampering or may indicate a bug—please report issues in the [repo](https://github.com/Raghava-Ch/RigVe/issues). Rest assured, all your data is processed in your personal environment safely. In windows OS it may ask the network permissions but don't worry, It happens becuse the tool is designed with client server architecutere and uses for the local host communications only.

### Usage Rights:
You may use this tool for any type of work—commercial, corporate, personal, community, or freelance.

### Redistribution:
You are not allowed to redistribute the complete package. The VS Code plugin comes with the MIT License, but please note that other proprietary components of the tool are restricted from redistribution.

You may develope your own plugin for your favorite editor stating that direct depandancy with the RigVe tool.

### Project Background:
I started this project as a hobby to ease my work in embedded software development environments, mostly for microcontrollers. Therefore, this tool is concentrated on such environments. However, the next release will be generic enough to work across all project environments and support other languages and diagrams (like class diagrams, package diagrams, etc.).

If you like the idea, please support me so that I can spend more time making it useful for more widely used languages and their developers! 😁
